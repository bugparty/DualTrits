#include "dual_trits_pack.hpp"
// This translation unit is intentionally left empty.
//
// All pack/unpack functionality is implemented in the header file.
// Because these functions are fully templated, their definitions must
// be visible to every translation unit that instantiates them. Placing
// the template definitions in a separate .cpp file would prevent proper
// template instantiation and result in undefined references at link time.
//
// The .cpp file is provided only to satisfy build systems that expect
// a corresponding implementation file.
